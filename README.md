This document summarizes the mathematical background needed to study the principles for 3D computer vision 
and navigation technology. It has been setup as follows:\
Basics:\
Part A and part B are excerpts of math at Bachelor level. They address the following topics:\
• Part A: Linear vector spaces\
o Definition of vectors.\
o Properties of vector spaces: inner product, norms, projection, orthogonality, and distance measures.\
• Part B: Matrix algebra.\
Intermediate level:\
Part C and part D are at Master level. The text is self-contained with the following topics:\
• Part C: how to represent position and orientation of objects in 3D space?\
• Part D: alternative representations of orientation; besides rotation matrices: Euler angles, Axis/angle, and 
quaternions.\
Advanced level:\ 
• Part E: kinematics of a moving object: linear and angular velocities and acceleration\

There will be 4 exercises in this module and one final project: \
Exercise 1: Virtual rotation of a camera
Exercise 2: 3D surface reconstruction 
Exercise 3: Keypoint detection and matching
Exercise 4: 3D surface mesh manipulation
Project: 3D Computer vision Application for QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF ACL INJURY
